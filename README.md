SQL Database for player and team information in the National Basketball Organization

## Application Background
The National Basketball Association (NBA) Stats database should serve as a resource in which all of the most recognizable and important statistics involved in the NBA can be accessed. Statistical analysis is a very important aspect of measuring success, overall impact, and trajectory of a player or team within the NBA. Having such statistics like points per game, overall win percentage, assists per player, and more advanced stats like defensive rating, Player Impact Rating (PIR), and the extremely complicated RAPTOR or “Robust Algorithm Player Tracking On/Off Ratings” to draw conclusions and measurements from, helps analysts and fans paint a much more defined picture of the sport as a whole. While having all of these statistics at your fingertips can help you formulate a near perfect understanding of the sport, for the purpose of this application, this database focuses on the lower-level statistics that help visualize a more general understanding of the game.

## Design
Included below is the conceptual design of the database, where five entities make up the core of the project. These entities cover the basic building blocks of the organization and only include some surface level and generic attributes. The logical design that follows paints a picture of the relationships included in the database between all of the entities and their attributes.

## Upcoming
The structure of the database is highly scalable and will likely include updates in the coming months such as web scrapers to help populate data, improved attributes, and upgraded queries.
